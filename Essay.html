    <br><h2>Essay:</h2>
    <p>Since the beginning of last October, Israel has successfully convinced the whole world to hate it even more. Amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Hamas, <strong>the brutal death of humanity and the unforgettable massacre of little joys have convinced humanists to boycott Israeli products to cause <dfn>economic damage </dfn>to its inhuman intentions.</strong></p>
    <p>Interestingly,boycott has garnered support not only from Muslims but also from peace advocates worldwide, transcending national and religious boundaries.<cite>(Al Jazeera. (2023, December 15). Boycotts and protests: How are people around the world defying Israel?)</cite> However, the protest has become more vocal among Muslims as the <strong>Al-Aqsa Mosque</strong> in Palestine is the matter of the dignity of the Muslim nation and the killing of Palestinian Muslims is indeed a slap upon the leaders of Muslim countries.</p>
    <p>When diplomatic responses by Muslim leadership and the so-called peace meetings of the UN Security Council could not stop Israel from launching attacks on innocent civilians, the majority of the Muslim nation decided themselves to boycott Israeli products to show solidarity with their Palestinian brothers and their martyrs and let the whole world know that nothing is more important to Muslims than their dignity and <b>Al-Aqsa is their dignity.</b></p>
    <p>The boycott of Israeli brands such as <strong>McDonald's, KFC </strong>alongside other brands has actually resulted in a huge economic loss to these companies which owe their affiliations with Israel. The boycott is also uplifting the local brands and strengthening local industries.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the boycott has conveyed a perception of unity among Muslims, and has delivered a message to the so-called guardians of democracy that their notion of justice is mere hypocrisy. The urgent necessity is take revenge from the murderers of justice and humanity by boycotting their products to bring a reverse gear to their evil economic investments associated with heinous crimes.</p>
